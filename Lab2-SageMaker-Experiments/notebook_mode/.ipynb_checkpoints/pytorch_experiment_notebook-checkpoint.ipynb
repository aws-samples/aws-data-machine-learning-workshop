    "# Track an experiment while training a Pytorch model locally or in your notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how you can use the SageMaker SDK to track a Machine Learning experiment using a Pytorch model trained locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce two concepts in this notebook -\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Experiment:* An experiment is a collection of runs. When you initialize a run in your training loop, you include the name of the experiment that the run belongs to. Experiment names must be unique within your AWS account. \n",
    "* *Run:* A run consists of all the inputs, parameters, configurations, and results for one iteration of model training. Initialize an experiment run for tracking a training job with Run(). \n",
    "\n",
    "To execute this notebook in SageMaker Studio, you should select the `PyTorch 1.12 Python 3.8 CPU Optimizer image`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can track artifacts for experiments, including datasets, algorithms, hyperparameters and metrics. Experiments executed on SageMaker such as SageMaker training jobs are automatically tracked and any existen SageMaker experiment on your AWS account is automatically migrated to the new UI version.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will demonstrate the capabilities through an MNIST handwritten digits classification example. The notebook is organized as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and prepare the MNIST dataset\n",
    "2. Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model and log the model training metrics\n",
    "3. Tune the hyperparameters that configures the number of hidden channels and the optimized in the model. Track teh parameter's configuration, resulting model loss and accuracy and automatically plot a confusion matrix using the Experiments capabilities of the SageMaker SDK.\n",
    "4. Analyse your model results and plot graphs comparing your model different runs generated from the tunning step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Runtime\n",
    "This notebook takes approximately 6~8 minutes to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reference to the github repo\n",
